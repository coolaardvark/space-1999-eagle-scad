# space-1999-eagle-scad
An open scad model of the Eagle Trasnporter from Space 1999

I'm using this model as the basis for a Blender model that I render and animate. Not sure if this is the right aproach, but it seems to me that the framework part of the spine would be very fiddly to build in Blender.
I export from Open SCAD in STL format for import to Blender.
